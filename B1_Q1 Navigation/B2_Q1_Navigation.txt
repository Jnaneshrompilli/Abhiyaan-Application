1)
• We call the uncertainty in data as noise. One of the best way to refine data is by denoising it by applying filters
• Filtering is a simple technique that we can use to smooth out the signal
• Some common filtering techniques are applying Low Pass Filter, High Pass Filter which can calculated by moving averages

• Also we can match the location from local sensory data with Global GPS for better navigation
